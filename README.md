# Project: CV App
### ‚û°Ô∏è The Challenge: Develop a dynamic CV builder that allows users to input their information in dedicated sections.
## üó∫ The guide
#### Step 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new React project using your preferred method

#### Step 2: Component Structure
Think about how to structure your application into components. Your application should include:
1. A section to add general information like name, email and phone number.
2. A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study and date of study)
3. A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

#### Step 3: Functionality Implementation
1. Implement input fields for each section to capture user information.
2. Include edit and submit buttons for each section or the entire CV (depending on your design).
   2.1 Submit button:
     - Collects user input from all fields
     - Displays the collected data in HTML elements (e.g., <p>, <h1>)
   2.2 Edit button:
     - Replaces displayed information with editable input fields containing the pre-filled user data.

#### Step 4: State Management
1. Utilize React state to manage the information entered by the user.
2. Update state values upon user interaction with input fields.

#### Step 5: Styling and Layout
1. Create a styles directory to store CSS files for styling your CV components.
2. Import CSS files into your component files for visual formatting.

#### Step 6: Deployment
Choose a deployment method to make your CV application accessible online (e.g., hosting on platforms like Netlify, Vercel).
